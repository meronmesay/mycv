    <article>
        <p>EM and REM are used mainly when working with responsive design.EM is dictated by the set parent size and REM is dictated by the set root (HTML document) size.<br>When rem is used on the font-size in the root element, it represents its initial value. If we set the font-size:16px of the root <html> element, then font-size of paragraph will be 1rem.<br> 
        Pixel is an absolute and fixed-size unit in CSS. Although the size of a pixel isnâ€™t always the same, the font-size, margin, and padding in pixel(px) remain same for<br> all the screens.pixels may be good at spacing and layout but are not good fit for font-size.<br>
        So, websites are more responsive when their size is adjusted using relative units (%,em,rem).</p>

        <p>The  specific changes in Css3 includes:
         <ul>
            <li>The ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.</li>
            <li>A box shadow that allows us to create a drop shadow for an element.</li>
            <li>New selectors were introduced,which can be used to find the html elements we want to style.</li>
            <li>A multicolumn layout is added to make variety of web designs.</li>
            <li>Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code</li>
        </ul>
